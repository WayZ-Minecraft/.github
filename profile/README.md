# WayZ

**WayZ** is inspired by the French series *HuntherZ* created by **GussDx**.  
It also draws inspiration from well-known servers such as **Decimation** and **Minekov**.

## Origins

The project began a long time ago — back in **2017**!  
We started working on it when we were only **14 years old**, using **Minecraft Forge 1.7.10**.  
Today, the project has grown significantly, and we’re now developing on **Fabric 1.16.5**.

The default assets were created by **3D3N** and **Vulga**, while the entire codebase was developed by **me (Niwer)**.  
We’ve built almost everything from scratch — from the **animation system** (yes, *GeckoLib* didn’t exist back then) to the **NPCs** and the **optimized OBJ renderer**.

## About the Mod

The mod is **closed-source**, but we’ve implemented a **content pack system** that lets you build your own server by creating your own **props**, **vehicles**, **guns**, **melee weapons**, and **armor**.  
Basically, every item you see in the default content packs is **not hardcoded**!

Note: This mod is closed-source and has been obfuscated using ProGuard to protect its code integrity.
